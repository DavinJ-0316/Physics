# Physics

- The idea is simple. We are going to create a physics world. This physics world is purely theoretical, and we cannot see it. But in this world, things fall, collide, rub, slide, etc.

- When we create a Three.js mesh, we will also create a version of that mesh inside the physics world. If we make a Box in Three.js, we also create a box in the physics world.
